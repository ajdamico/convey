Moreover, it presents a new measure which generalises Bourguignon (1999) and includes Tsui measures (1999), while preserving the advantages of Maasoumi's method (1986) of explicitly acknowledging the role of parameters relevant to multivariate settings. Finally, an application to Argentine data is provided in order to illustrate the decisions involved in the process of applying these measures and the usefulness of having appropriate criteria when making those decisions. }

  abstract={This paper proposes a new methodology for multidimensional poverty measurement consisting of an identification method [rho]k that extends the traditional intersection and union approaches, and a class of poverty measures M[alpha]. Our identification step employs two forms of cutoff: one within each dimension to determine whether a person is deprived in that dimension, and a second across dimensions that identifies the poor by 'counting' the dimensions in which a person is deprived. The aggregation step employs the FGT measures, appropriately adjusted to account for multidimensionality. The axioms are presented as joint restrictions on identification and the measures, and the methodology satisfies a range of desirable properties including decomposability. The identification method is particularly well suited for use with ordinal data, as is the first of our measures, the adjusted headcount ratio M0. We present some dominance results and an interpretation of the adjusted headcount ratio as a measure of unfreedom. Examples from the US and Indonesia illustrate our methodology.},

	abstract = {MPI estimates the Adjusted Multidimensional Headcount Ratio developed by Alkire and Foster (2011), also known as the Multidimensional Poverty Index. With ordinal and real-valued indicators MPI allows estimating the entire parametric class of Alkire-Foster poverty measures for arbitrary values of the poverty-aversion parameter. All poverty measures can be conveniently decomposed by deprivation indicators and population sub-groups. Users can specify an indefinite number of indicators and use a flexible weighting structure for each of them. Poverty thresholds can be set directly within the command line using a flexible notation for identifying who is above or below the threshold. Deprivation indicators can be grouped into broader policy domains which simplifies the analysis of results in many empirical applications. The survey design is fully taken into account when computing indicators, standard errors and covariances. MPI allows using standard Stata features such as nonparametric bootstrap estimation of the results and mean-comparison tests.},

The general functional form of decomposable indices is derived without assuming that the measures are differentiable. The analysis is suitable for extension to the many other kinds of indices for which a similar relationship between the overall index value and subaggregates is desirable.},

abstract = "Abstract This survey presents an account of univariate and multivariate majorization orderings and their characterization by various classes of economic disparity indices. First, a concise treatment of classical univariate results is given, including majorization with different means and different population sizes, as well as Lorenz orderings of relative and absolute disparity. Second, alternatives to the Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers are discussed which are based on transfers about a given threshold. Third, disparity in several attributes and multivariate majorization are investigated, and a multivariate version of the Lorenz curved is introduced."
